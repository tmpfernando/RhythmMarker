0~RED~Hello! Finally you wake up... I thought you where dead! Come closer maybe you can move your LEGS today.
1~RED~You can use WASD keys to WALK each hit will correspond to one STEP.
2~BLUE~I know that! It is really exhaustive but you can use DPAD or LEFT ANALOGâ€¦ if you have a JOYPAD.
3~GREEN~NICE!!! Great work! Before conquering the universe you will have to learn WALK.
4~GREEN~About MUSICS, you will score positive if you make the steps on correct RHYTHM TIME, otherwise you will loose points.
5~BLUE~The GRID below you BLINKS in time with the song... You can correct the FLASH TIME on MENU, if DELAY button where active.
6~RED~Hey!!! The DELAY button hasn't been activated yet, I'll ask the developer to program it as soon as possible.
7~GREEN~And... There was something about the melody, but I can not remember now...
8~INVERSE WAVE~WATCHOUT FOR FLUTUATIONS...
